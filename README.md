# react-native-sms-retriever

With the SMS Retriever API, you can perform SMS-based user verification in your Android app automatically, without requiring the user to manually type verification codes, and without requiring any extra app permissions.


I have problems to get the SMS content, when using react-native-sms-retriever library due to hash key mismatch issue. I was created hash key with other process and included in this repository. You can get SMS content using this App.
